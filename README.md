# THE STARFLEET MARS STARGATE AQUEMENIS IS A SHORTCHANGE RUNNING GATE AND NOT A STARGATE BY DEFINITION

![Starfleet Mars Gate Aquemenis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoryAndrewHofstad/Starfleet-Mars-Stargate-Aquemenis/master/Earth%20Running%20Gate/images/Google%20Maps/Screen%20Shot%202020-01-29%20at%202.50.27%20PM.png)

The Starfleet running gate at gasworks park was made from a single coil of aluminum wound 27 times and broken into two sections.

Chemical bonds which are physically broken, yet chemically stable allow electromagnetic resonance to travel the full length of the coil even though it is broken into two pieces which are seperated a great distance.

Bending the coil at the ends of both sections creates an open ended resonance which travels the full length of both coil sections.

One half of the coil is installed at gasworks park and the other half is installed in Mars' South Crater.

Balances are used to maintain equal ambient electomagnetic fields at either installation. A Heartbeat pulse runs through the gates.



In the configuration which exists, simply running the length of the coil starting from the concrete sidewalk at gasworks park will deliver your person 150 meters north the Mars coil.

WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOU MAY SEE SOME KIND OF LIGHT TUNNEL, KEEP RUNNING 150 METERS.

WHEN YOU REACH MARS, YOU WILL BE IN A DESERT.

TURN AROUND AND TRAVEL 150 METERS BACK THE WAY YOU CAME TO GET BACK TO EARTH.

RUN THROUGH THE MARS GATE TO GET BACK TO EARTH.
