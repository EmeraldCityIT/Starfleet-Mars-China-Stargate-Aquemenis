# PRE FLIGHT CHECKLIST

!!!IMMUNE SYSTEM WARNING!!!
Successful travel through the Running Gate network requires 2 months minimum of daily Colloidal Silver, Zinc, and Tumeric consumption. Physalia physalis pycnogonida use the gate to enter Seattle and China from Mars. While decontamination is underway, use extreme caution. Pycnogonida is a threat that we have been dealing with forever, we are discovering new defense methods and ant-pycnogonida weapons daily. 
!!!IMMUNE SYSTEM WARNING!!!

The StarFleet Mars and China Stargate is by definition a ShortPoint chemically bonded double latch circuit transport responder (Running Gate). When two latch circuits are built-in series into the same aluminum coil they can pass from the first buffer to the second buffer any field contained within the coil's EM field. When a physical break occurs between the first and second latch circuit, chemical bonds which remain between the two resulting sections of the coil. Through these chemical connections, electromagnetic ion flow transfer fields and associated material great distances between the two severed coil sections. This method allows kilometers of coil sections to be prefabricated, segmented and shipped to remote locations to create daisy-chained transportation networks (Running Gate Network).

The StarFleet Mars Seattle StarGate Aqueminis is a section located in Seattle, WA, America, Earth. that is chemically bonded to coils on Mars and China. Various supply locations are available for food, medical kits, clothing, cannabis, hardware, electronics, computers, etc. Running the gate westward will take you to Mars. Mars has an atmosphere like Earth, but the wildlife is out of control. Pycnogonida exists on Mars in dangerous quantities. Full facial protection and the ability to run at least 500 meters is required. Walking the gate at a quick pace will to the east will take you to Hong Kong International Airport Train Station on Chek Lap Kok. Eye protection is required in China, mouth protection is required during corona or SARS epidemics.

The Mars gate will take you to a series of running gates planted within Mars South Crater. Coils in Mars South Crater bridge traffic to Andromeda, Saiya, Krypton, Hybuses, HyperBaad, Plesk, and multiple galaxies. Transit through Mars Crater is dangerous.

The China Gate will take you to Seattle, or the Moon.

There exists a buried verticle coil at 47.646035, -122.334814 to Nemesis.

A verticle coil to Cruize is installed at 47.645749, -122.333521

A Time Capsule exists at 47.645745, -122.333228 (20 Minutes in Capusule = 5 HRS OUTSIDE Capsule)

# THE STARFLEET MARS STARGATE AQUEMENIS IS A SHORTCHANGE RUNNING GATE AND NOT A STARGATE BY DEFINITION

![Starfleet Mars Gate Aquemenis](https://github.com/CoryAndrewHofstad/Starfleet-Mars-Stargate-Aquemenis/blob/master/Earth%20Running%20Gate/images/Google%20Maps/Screen%20Shot%202020-01-29%20at%202.50.15%20PM.png)

The Starfleet running gate at gasworks park was made from a single 20'1" diameter coil of 3" diameter aluminum wound 27 times. The giant coil is broken into two sections in the middle. One end is installed on Earth, The other end is installed on Mars.

Chemical bonds which are physically broken, yet chemically stable allow electromagnetic resonance to travel the full length of the coil even though it is broken into two pieces which are seperated a great distance.

Bending the coil at the ends of both sections creates an open ended resonance which travels the full length of both coil sections.

One half of the coil is installed at gasworks park and the other half is installed in Mars' South Crater.

Balances are used to maintain equal ambient electomagnetic fields at either installation. A Heartbeat pulse runs through the gates.



In the configuration which exists, simply running the length of the coil starting from the concrete sidewalk at gasworks park will deliver your person 150 meters north the Mars coil.

LARGE ANIMAL PREDATORS ARE OUT AT NIGHT.

SOLDIERS WILL KILL YOU AS IF YOU WERE AN INVADING FORCE IF YOU DO NOT ACT RIGHT.

SOLDIERS KILL CRIMINALS ON CONTACT.

RUN INTO THE EARTH GATE

WHEN YOU GET TO THE END YOU MAY SEE SOME KIND OF LIGHT TUNNEL, KEEP RUNNING 150 METERS.

AT 150 METERS YOU WILL INSTANTANEOUSLY BE IN THE MARS DESERT.

TURN AROUND AND TRAVEL 150 METERS BACK THE WAY YOU CAME TO GET BACK TO EARTH GATE (SOUTH).

RUN THROUGH THE EARTH GATE (SOUTH) TO GET BACK TO EARTH.
