# !IMMUNE SYSTEM WARNING!

Successful travel through the Running Gate network requires 2 months minimum of daily Colloidal Silver, Zinc, and Tumeric consumption. Physalia physalis pycnogonida use the gate to enter Seattle and China from Mars. While decontamination is underway, use extreme caution. Pycnogonida is a threat that we have been dealing with forever, we are discovering new defense methods and anti-pycnogonida weapons daily. 

## HOW DOES STARFLEET MARS CHINA STARGATE WORK?

The StarFleet Mars and China Stargate is by definition a ShortPoint chemically bonded double latch circuit transport responder (Running Gate). When two latch circuits are built-in series into the same aluminum coil they can pass from the first buffer to the second buffer any field contained within the coil's EM field. When a physical break occurs between the first and second latch circuit, chemical bonds which remain between the two resulting sections of the coil. Through these chemical connections, electromagnetic ion flow transfer fields and associated material great distances between the two severed coil sections. This method allows kilometers of coil sections to be prefabricated, segmented and shipped to remote locations to create daisy-chained transportation networks (Running Gate Network).

The StarFleet Mars Seattle StarGate Aqueminis is a section located in Seattle, WA, America, Earth. that is chemically bonded to coils on Mars and China. Various supply locations are available for food, medical kits, clothing, cannabis, hardware, electronics, computers, etc. The Starfleet running gate at gasworks park was made from a single 20'1" diameter coil of 3" diameter aluminum wound 27 times. The giant coil is broken into sections at the midpoint of two latch circuits. A portion of segmented coil is installed at Gasworks Park in Seattle, WA, America on earth. The other western most portion of the Gasworks park segment is bonded to another segment installed on Mars.  The Eastern most portion of the Gasworks Park segment is boned to a coil descretely installed in Hong Kong International Airport on Chek Lap Kok.

# TRANSIT TO MARS

![Starfleet Mars Gate Aquemenis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoryAndrewHofstad/Starfleet-Mars-Stargate-Aquemenis/master/Starfleet-Mars-Shortpoint-Station-Map.jpg)

The Mars gate will take you to a series of running gates planted within Mars South Crater. Coils in Mars South Crater bridge traffic to Andromeda, Saiya, Krypton, Hybuses, HyperBaad, Plesk, and multiple galaxies. Transit through Mars Crater is dangerous. Mars has an atmosphere like Earth, but the wildlife is out of control. Pycnogonida exists on Mars in dangerous quantities. Full facial protection and the ability to run at least 1.25 kilometers is required. 


### MARS IS DANGEROUS

* POACHING WILL GET YOU KILLED

* ANIMALS WILL KILL YOU

* STARFLEET KILLS CRIMINALS

* DO NOT TRAVEL WITHOUT COLLOIDAL SILVER, ZINC, AND TUMERIC IN YOUR SYSTEM

### TRAVEL AT NOON 11:00-2:15
* NASA PROVIDES A DOWNLOADABLE MARS SUN CLOCK FOR SHORTCHANGE TRAVELERS.

* INSECT PREDATORS ARE OUT IN THE MORNING WHEN THE DEW IS THAWING AND CREATURES ARE WAKING UP FROM A FROZEN STATE (BEWARE OF SLEEPING UNPROTECTED).

* LARGE ANIMAL PREDATORS ARE OUT AT NIGHT.

* SOLDIERS WILL KILL YOU AS IF YOU WERE AN INVADING FORCE IF YOU DO NOT ACT RIGHT.

* SOLDIERS KILL CRIMINALS ON CONTACT.

* SOLDIERS HAVE FACIAL DATABASES.

* MARS HAS SWITCHED TO ZERO.

## INSTRUCTIONS



1. RUN INTO THE EARTH GATE

2. WHEN YOU PASS INTO MARS THERE WILL BE A LEFT TURN AND A LONG TUNNEL KEEP RUNNING DO NOT SLOW DOWN.

3. START SPRINTING, KEEP RUNNING 150 METERS.

4. TURN AROUND AND TRAVEL 150 METERS BACK THE WAY YOU CAME TO GET BACK TO EARTH GATE (SOUTH).

5. RUN THROUGH THE EARTH GATE (SOUTH) TO GET BACK TO EARTH.

# TRANSIT TO CHINA

Walking the gate at a quick pace will to the east will take you to Hong Kong International Airport Train Station on Chek Lap Kok. Eye protection is required in China, mouth protection is required during corona or SARS epidemics.

# StarFleet Transit Station Aqueminis
The China Gate will take you to Seattle, or the Moon.

There exists a buried verticle coil at 47.646035, -122.334814 to Nemesis.

A verticle coil to Cruize is installed at 47.645749, -122.333521

A Time Capsule exists at 47.645745, -122.333228 (20 Minutes in Capusule = 5 HRS OUTSIDE Capsule)

Transistor stacks throughout Gasworks park are used to maintain equal ambient electomagnetic fields at either installation. A Heartbeat pulse runs through the gates.
